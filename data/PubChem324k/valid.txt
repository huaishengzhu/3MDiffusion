ARV-471 is composed of an ER alpha ligand attached to an E3 ligase recognition moiety. Upon oral administration, ARV-471 targets and binds to the ER ligand binding domain on ER alpha. E3 ligase is recruited to the ER by the E3 ligase recognition moiety and ER alpha is tagged by ubiquitin. This causes ubiquitination and degradation of ER alpha by the proteasome. This decreases ER alpha protein levels, decreases the expression of ER alpha-target genes and halts ER-mediated signaling. This results in an inhibition of proliferation in ER alpha-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, the degradation of the ER alpha protein releases the ARV-471 and can bind to additional ER alpha target proteins. ER alpha is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation.

The molecule is an orally bioavailable macrocyclic lactone derived from Streptomyces avermitilis, with antiparasitic and potential anti-viral activities. Upon administration, ivermectin exerts its anthelmintic effect through binding and activating glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) expressed on nematode neurons and pharyngeal muscle cells. This causes increased permeability of chloride ions, causing a state of hyperpolarization and results in the paralysis and death of the parasite. Ivermectin may exerts its antiviral effect, including its potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), by binding to the importin (IMP) alpha/beta1 heterodimer, which is responsible for the nuclear import of viral proteins such as the integrase (IN) protein. This inhibits nuclear import of host and viral proteins and may inhibit viral replication.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as paritaprevir. As a newer generation and directly acting HCV antiviral, paritaprevir products have better Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates, higher barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and a reduced pill burden compared to older agents such as [DB08873], [DB05521], [DB00008], [DB00022], and [DB00811]. By combining multiple antiretroviral medications into fixed dose products, the viral lifecycle can be targeted at multiple stages while simultaneously reducing the risk of developing resistant viral strains. Within Canada and the United States, paritaprevir is currently available in three fixed dose products: Viekira Pak (FDA), Technivie (FDA and Health Canada), and Holkira Pak (Health Canada).  More specifically, paritaprevir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, paritaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function.   In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Paritaprevir as a first line therapy option when used in combination with other antivirals for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4. Depending on the genotype, Paritaprevir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09296], [DB09183], [DB00503], and [DB00811], with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as paritaprevir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects.   Paritaprevir first came on the market as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB00503] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with [DB00811] for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.  Paritaprevir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296] and [DB00503] as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie. First approved in July 2015, Technivie is indicated in combination with [DB00811] for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.  In Canada, paritaprevir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB00503] as the Health Canada-approved, commercially available product Holkira Pak. First approved in January 2015, Holkira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b with or without cirrhosis, and when combined with [DB00811] for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with or without cirrhosis.

In contrast with other xanthine derivatives, doxofylline does not significantly bind to adenosine alpha-1 or alpha-2 receptors and lacks stimulating effects. Decreased affinity for adenosine receptors may account for the better safety profile of doxofylline compared to theophylline. Unlike theophylline, doxofylline does not affect calcium influx and does not antagonize the actions of calcium channel blockers which could explain reduced cardiac adverse reactions associated with the drug. The anti-asthmatic effects of doxophylline are mediated by other mechanisms, primarily through inhibiting the activities of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme.

Codeine sulfate mimics the actions of opioids by binding to the opioid receptors at many sites within the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of the mu-subtype opioid receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex and subsequently inhibits adenylate cyclase. This results in a decrease in intracellular cAMP and leads to a reduction in the release of neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline. The analgesic effect of codeine sulfate is likely due to its metabolite morphine, which induces opening of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels and blocks the opening of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, thereby resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.

DMSO is also employed as a rinsing agent in the electronics industry and, in its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), is a useful solvent in NMR due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of chemical compounds and its minimal interference with the sample signals. In cryobiology DMSO has been used as a cryoprotectant and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cell, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10% DMSO and 90% fetal calf serum. As part of an autologous bone marrow transplant the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient's own hematopoietic stem cell. Dimethyl sulfoxide is a by-product of wood pulping. One of the leading suppliers of DMSO is the Gaylord company in the USA. DMSO is frequently used as solvent in a number of chemical reactions. In particular it is an excellent reaction solvent for SN2 alkylations: it is possible to alkylate indoles with very high yields using potassium hydroxide as the base and a similar reaction also occurs with phenols. DMSO can be reacted with methyl iodide to form a sulfoxonium ion which can be reacted with sodium hydride to form a sulfur ylide. The methyl groups of DMSO are somewhat acidic in character (pKa=35) due to the stabilization of the resultant anions by the sulfoxide group. The molecule is used widely as a chemical solvent.

644019	CCCCCC1=CC(=C(C(=C1)O)[C@@H]2C=C(CC[C@H]2C(=C)C)C)O	The molecule is an cannabinoid that is cyclohexene which is substituted by a methyl group at position 1, a 2,6-dihydroxy-4-pentylphenyl group at position 3, and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 4. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a member of resorcinols, an olefinic compound and a phytocannabinoid. The molecule is one of at least 85 active cannabinoids identified within the Cannabis plant. It is a major phytocannabinoid, accounting for up to 40% of the Cannabis plant's extract, that binds to a wide variety of physiological targets of the endocannabinoid system within the body. Although the exact medical implications are currently being investigated, CBD has shown promise as a therapeutic and pharmaceutical drug target. In particular, CBD has shown promise as an analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, among other currently investigated uses. CBD's exact place within medical practice is still currently hotly debated, however as the body of evidence grows and legislation changes to reflect its wide-spread use, public and medical opinion have changed significantly with regards to its usefulness in a number of medical conditions ranging from anxiety to epilepsy.  From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' (and CBD's) diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body. Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Through its modulation of neurotransmitter release, the endocannabinoid system regulates cognition, pain sensation, appetite, memory, sleep, immune function, and mood among many other bodily systems. These effects are largely mediated through two members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, with the majority of receptors localized to the hippocampus and amygdala of the brain. Physiological effects of using cannabis make sense in the context of its receptor activity as the hippocampus and amygdala are primarily involved with regulation of memory, fear, and emotion. In contrast, CB2 receptors are mainly found peripherally in immune cells, lymphoid tissue, and peripheral nerve terminals.  Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. Although THC and CBD have been the most studied cannabinoids, there are many others identified to date including cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), [DB14050] (CBDV), and [DB11755] (THCV) that can be found within the medical cannabis. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms of THC like [DB00470] or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.  The primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site which is clinically significant as direct agonists (such as THC) are limited by their psychomimetic effects such as changes to mood, memory, and anxiety.   In addition to the well-known activity on CB1 and CB2 receptors, there is further evidence that CBD also activates 5-HT1A/2A/3A serotonergic and TRPV1–2 vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha-1 adrenergic and µ-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and cellular uptake of anandamide, acts on mitochondria Ca2+ stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2+ channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH).  CBD is currently available in Canada within a 1:1 formulation with tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) (as the formulation known as "nabiximols") as the brand name product Sativex. It is approved for use as adjunctive treatment for symptomatic relief of spasticity in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Sativex was also given a conditional Notice of Compliance (NOC/c) for use as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adult patients with multiple sclerosis and as adjunctive analgesic treatment for moderate to severe pain in adult patients with advanced cancer.  In April 2018, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel unanimously recommended approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol oral solution) for the treatment of two rare forms of epilepsy - Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, which are among the two most difficult types of epilepsy to treat. Epidiolex was granted Orphan Drug designation as well as Fast Track Approval from the FDA for further study in these hard to treat conditions. Notably, phase 3 clinical trials of Epidiolex have demonstrated clinically significant improvement in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. On June 25th, 2018, Epidiolex was approved by the FDA to be the first CBD-based product available on the US market. The molecule is as a Cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2C9 Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2C19 Inhibitor, and UGT1A9 Inhibitor, and UGT2B7 Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 1A2 Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2B6 Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2B6 Inducer. The molecule is an orally available cannabinoid that is used to treat patients with refractory epilepsy due to Lennox-Gastaut or Dravet syndrome. Cannabidiol is associated with frequent serum enzyme elevations during therapy particularly with higher doses but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. The molecule is a natural product found in Cannabis sativa with data available. The molecule is a phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis species, which is devoid of psychoactive activity, with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic and chemopreventive activities. Upon administration, cannabidiol (CBD) exerts its anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic activity through various mechanisms, which likely do not involve signaling by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), CB2, or vanilloid receptor 1. CBD stimulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inhibits AKT/mTOR signaling, thereby activating autophagy and promoting apoptosis. In addition, CBD enhances the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further enhances apoptosis. This agent also upregulates the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1) and decreases the expression of inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID-1). This inhibits cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. CBD may also activate the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 2 (TRPV2), which may increase the uptake of various cytotoxic agents in cancer cells. The analgesic effect of CBD is mediated through the binding of this agent to and activation of CB1. The molecule isolated from Cannabis sativa extract.

It is an oral anthelmintic drug approved for use against tapeworm infections. It has a role as a piscicide, a molluscicide, an antiparasitic agent, an anticoronaviral agent, an anthelminthic drug, an apoptosis inducer and a STAT3 inhibitor. It is a member of monochlorobenzenes, a member of salicylanilides, a C-nitro compound, a secondary carboxamide and a member of benzamides. It is functionally related to a 5-chlorosalicylic acid. The molecule is an antihelminthic used for the treatment of tapeworm infections. Helminths (worms) are multicellular organisms that infect very large numbers of humans and cause a broad range of diseases. Over 1 billion people are infected with intestinal nematodes, and many millions are infected with filarial nematodes, flukes, and tapeworms. They are an even greater problem in domestic animals.  Niclosamide, once marketed in the US under the brand name Niclocide, was voluntarily withdrawn from market by Bayer in 1996. The molecule is an orally bioavailable chlorinated salicylanilide, with anthelmintic and potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, niclosamide specifically induces degradation of the androgen receptor (AR) variant V7 (AR-V7) through the proteasome-mediated pathway. This downregulates the expression of the AR variant, inhibits AR-V7-mediated transcriptional activity, and reduces AR-V7 recruitment to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene promoter. Niclosamide also prevents AR-V7-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. This inhibits AR/STAT3-mediated signaling and prevents expression of STAT3 target genes. Altogether, this may inhibit growth of AR-V7-overexpressing cancer cells. The AR-V7 variant, which is encoded by contiguous splicing of AR exons 1/2/3/CE3, is upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types, and is associated with both cancer progression and resistance to AR-targeted therapies. The molecule is used for the treatment of most tapeworm infections. Helminths (worms) are multicellular organisms that infect very large numbers of humans and cause a broad range of diseases. Over 1 billion people are infected with intestinal nematodes, and many millions are infected with filarial nematodes, flukes, and tapeworms. They are an even greater problem in domestic animals.

The molecule is a natural product found in Colchicum arenarium, Colchicum bivonae, and other organisms with data available. The molecule is an alkaloid isolated from Colchicum autumnale with anti-gout and anti-inflammatory activities. The exact mechanism of action by which colchicines exerts its effect has not been completely established. Colchicine binds to tubulin, thereby interfering with the polymerization of tubulin, interrupting microtubule dynamics, and disrupting mitosis. This leads to an inhibition of migration of leukocytes and other inflammatory cells, thereby reducing the inflammatory response to deposited urate crystals.  Colchicine may also interrupt the cycle of monosodium urate crystal deposition in joint tissues, thereby also preventing the resultant inflammatory response. Overall, colchicine decreases leukocyte chemotaxis/migration and phagocytosis to inflamed areas, and inhibits the formation and release of a chemotactic glycoprotein that is produced during phagocytosis of urate crystals. The molecule is in the treatment of gout, but it has been used also in the therapy of familial Mediterranean fever (PERIODIC DISEASE).

It is an enantiomer of a (R)-ketamine. The molecule is a significant cause of disability worldwide and the most common illness preceding suicide. On March 5, 2019, the nasal spray drug, esketamine, also known as Spravato (by Janssen Pharmaceuticals), was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depression.   Esketamine is the s-enantiomer of [Ketamine]. Ketamine is a mixture of two enantiomers (mirror image molecules). This is the first time that the FDA has approved esketamine for any use. The FDA approved ketamine (Ketalar) in 1970.  Esketamine may prove to be a promising treatment for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder who have not experienced an improvement in symptoms despite treatment with various medications and therapies. The intranasal route of administration for this drug allows for easy administration and a fast onset of action, which sets it apart from many other antidepressant agents that may take several weeks to take effect. The molecule is unique antidepressant administered as an intranasal spray as therapy of treatment- resistant depression in adults. Esketamine has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations during treatment nor to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. The molecule is a cyclohexanone derivative and S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, with analgesic, anesthetic and antidepressant activities. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, upon administration, esketamine targets, non-competitively binds to, and blocks N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. This reduces pain perception, induces sedation, and produce dissociative anesthesia.

7111	C1=CC(=CC=C1C2=CC=C(C=C2)N)N	Benzidine appears as a grayish-yellow to grayish-red, crystalline solid. Toxic by ingestion, inhalation, and skin absorption. Combustion produces toxic oxides of nitrogen. Used to make other chemicals and in chemical and biological analysis. The molecule is a manufactured chemical that does not occur naturally. It is a crystalline solid that may be grayish-yellow, white, or reddish-gray. In the environment, benzidine is found in either its "free" state (as an organic base), or as a salt. Benzidine was used to produce dyes for cloth, paper, and leather. It is no longer produced or used commerically in the U.S. The molecule is a member of the class of biphenyls that is 1,1'-biphenyl in which the hydrogen at the para-position of each phenyl group has been replaced by an amino group. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent. It is a member of biphenyls and a substituted aniline. The molecule is no longer produced in the United States, although benzidine-based dyes may be imported into this country. No information is available on the acute (short-term) effects of benzidine in humans by inhalation exposure but benzidine is considered to be very acutely toxic to humans by ingestion. Chronic (long-term) exposure to benzidine in humans may result in injury to the bladder. Epidemiological studies have shown occupational exposure to benzidine to result in an increased risk of bladder cancer. Animal studies have reported various tumor types at multiple sites from benzidine exposure via oral, inhalation, and injection exposure. EPA has classified benzidine as a Group A, known human carcinogen. The molecule is a grayish-red, yellowish or white colored, very toxic, crystalline aromatic amine that darkens when exposed to air and light. Benzidine has been widely used for the detection of blood and as a reagent in the manufacture of dyes. Ingestion of benzidine causes cyanosis, headache, mental confusion, nausea and vomiting. Its use is now limited because of strong association between exposure to benzidine and an increased risk of bladder cancer in humans. (NCI05) The molecule is the organic compound with the formula (C6H4NH2)2. it is an aromatic amine. It is prepared in a two step process from nitrobenzene. First, the nitrobenzene is converted to 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, usually using iron powder as the reducing agent. Treatment of this hydrazine with mineral acids induces a rearrangement reaction to 4,4'-benzidine. Smaller amounts of other isomers are also formed. The benzidine rearrangement, which proceeds intramolecularly, is a classic mechanistic puzzle in organic chemistry.  This aromatic amine is a component of a test for cyanide and also in the production of dyes. Benzidine has been linked to bladder and pancreatic cancer. Since August 2010 benzidine dyes are included in the EPA's List of Chemicals of Concern.

Evolves CO2 when moist. This can cause over-pressurization in an enclosed space.Toxic and carcinogenic. Used in polyurethane foams, coatings in floor and wood finishes, sealers, paints, concrete sealers for aircraft and tank trucks, elastomers in clay pipe seals, elastomers and coatings, and crosslinking agent for nylon.   Rate of onset: Immediate  Persistence: Hours - weeks  Odor threshold: 0.4 - 2 ppm  Source/use/other hazard: Polyurethane (wood coatings, foam), nylon industries; skin irritant. The molecule isomeric forms (2,4-toluene diisocyanate and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate) which have similar properties and effects. Toluene diisocyanate is produced commercially as an 80:20 (2,4-toluene diisocyanate:2,6-toluene diisocyanate) mixture of the two isomers. At room temperature, the mixture is a clear, pale yellow liquid with a sharp, pungent odor. It should be stored under refrigeration, away from light and moisture in a tightly closed container under an inert atmosphere. Toluene diisocyanate is insoluble in water and miscible with most common organic solvents. The molecule is a toluene meta-diisocyanate in which the isocyanato groups are at positions 2 and 4 relative to the methyl group on the benzene ring. It has a role as a hapten and an allergen. The molecule is primarily used as a chemical intermediate in the production of polyurenthane products. 2,4-Toluene diisocyanate is extremely toxic from acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) exposures. Acute exposure to high levels of 2,4-toluene diisocyanate in humans, via inhalation, results in severe irritation of the skin and eyes and affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems (CNS). Chronic inhalation exposure to 2,4-toluene diisocyanate in humans has resulted in significant decreases in lung function in workers, an asthma-like reaction characterized by wheezing, dyspnea, and bronchial constriction. Animal studies have reported significantly increased incidences of tumors of the pancreas, liver, and mammary glands from exposure to 2,4-toluene diisocyanate via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified 2,4-toluene diisocyanate as a Group 2B, possible human carcinogen. The molecule is a synthetic mixture of the 2,4- and 2,6-isomers is a volatile, colorless to pale yellow liquid that is soluble in many organic solvents. These isomers are used primarily in the synthesis of polyurethane foams. When heated to decomposition, toluene diisocyanate emits toxic fumes of cyanides and nitrogen oxides. Exposure of humans to toluene diisocyanate causes tissue irritation, especially to the mucous membranes, and can produce severe respiratory problems. These isomers are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens. (NCI05) The molecule is a chemical compound of cyanide and an aromatic diisocyanate with the formula CH3C6H3(NCO)2. It is used in the manufacture of polyurethane. (L577) Two of the six possible isomers are commercially important: 2,4-TDI (CAS: 584-84-9) and 2,6-TDI (CAS: 91-08-7). 2,4-TDI is produced in the pure state, but TDI is often marketed as 80/20 and 65/35 mixtures of the 2,4 and 2,6 isomers respectively. It is produced on a large scale, accounting for 34.1% of the global isocyanate market in 2000, second only to MDI. The molecule is a chemical compound of cyanide. Skin irritant and allergen used in the manufacture of polyurethane foams and other elastomers.

The molecule is a phosphoramidate-based prodrug of the monophosphate (MP) form of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR; FUDR), the active metabolite of fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of the nucleotide analog prodrug fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is readily taken up by tumor cells. In the tumor cell, the phosphoramidate moiety is removed and fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is converted to its active form FUDR-MP. In turn, FUDR-MP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) and thus DNA synthesis. With the phosphoramidate moiety attached to FUDR-MP, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, compared to 5-FU, is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, thereby generating higher intracellular concentrations. In addition, compared to 5-FU, once inside the cell FUDR-MP does not need to be phosphorylated and is already in its active form. Unlike 5-FU, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide does not get deactivated or converted into toxic metabolites by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which leads to both a longer half-life and less toxicity.

The molecule is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. The molecule is a Sulfonylurea. The molecule is a long-acting, first-generation sulfonylurea with hypoglycemic activity. Compared to other sulfonylureas, chlorpropamide has an increased risk of prolonged hypoglycemia because of its long half-life.

It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent, a potassium channel blocker, a human metabolite and an insulin secretagogue. The molecule is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver. Tolbutamide and its metabolites are excreted in urine (75-85%) and feces. The molecule is a Sulfonylurea. The molecule is a natural product found in Homo sapiens with data available. The molecule is a short-acting, first-generation sulfonylurea with hypoglycemic activity.
